Hi, I'm Vic⚡ - an independent (mostly) frontend developer, based in [Nairobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi), Kenya. I enjoy working exclusively with basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript to create immersive, performant & amazing web experiences. The web is a powerful platform and my goal is to harness its immense capabilities using browser-native technologies. I work both as a freelance & contract developer, and on consulting roles for individuals & institutions looking to build pretty, performant web applications. I'm a huge tech nerd/geek, music-lover & video game player.
